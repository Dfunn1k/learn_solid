# SRP: Single Responsibility Principle
The Single Responsibility Principle states that a class should have only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job.
* Single Responsibility: A class should focus on a single task or purpose. It should not mix responsibilities that are not directly related to each other.
* Reason for change: If a class has multiple responsibilities, any change to one of them could affect other parts of the class, making maintenance difficult and increasing the risk of introducing bugs.
